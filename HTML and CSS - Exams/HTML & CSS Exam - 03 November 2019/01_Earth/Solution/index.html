                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to
                    harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence,
                    Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.

                    Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing
                    seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon
                    causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows
                    its rotation.
